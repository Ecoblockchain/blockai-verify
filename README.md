# blockai-verify

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blockai/blockai-verify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blockai/blockai-verify)

This is a client side library and web UI for verifying Blockai issued proofs.

Proofs are composed of a merkle branch, original data and a root hash which is written on the Bitcoin blockchain, effectively timestamping the data.

The proof format is based on [chainpoint proof format](https://github.com/chainpoint/whitepaper/raw/master/chainpoint_white_paper.pdf).
